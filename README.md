  <h1>Getting Started with Graphix AI</h1>

  <p>Graphix AI provides an innovative solution for users to rent GPU resources for high-performance computing. Follow these steps to seamlessly rent nodes and get started using GPU power for various tasks. The platform operates using <strong>$GRAPHIX tokens</strong>, which are required for all payments.</p>

  <h2>Steps to Rent a Node</h2>

  <h3>1. Wallet Connection</h3>
  <p>Connect your digital wallet to the <a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">Graphix AI's GPU Nodes Platform</a>. You will need $GRAPHIX tokens to complete any payments for rentals.</p>

  <h3>2. Node Selection</h3>
  <p>Explore available GPU nodes and choose one that matches your computational needs, whether for rendering, AI training, or data processing. Available GPUs include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">NVIDIA RTX A5500</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">NVIDIA RTX A6000</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>3. Set Rental Duration</h3>
  <p>Select the duration for which you need the GPU node. The platform offers flexibility for both short-term and long-term projects.</p>

  <h3>4. Payment with $GRAPHIX Tokens</h3>
  <p>Confirm your rental details and complete the transaction using $GRAPHIX tokens. This step ensures an efficient payment process, allowing access to GPU resources.</p>

  <h3>5. Access Your Rented Node</h3>
  <p>After successful payment, your rented node will appear under the "Account" section. It may take a few minutes for the node to be fully operational.</p>

  <h3>6. Retrieve Access Credentials</h3>
  <p>For each session, unique credentials are generated. Click on your rental to retrieve the necessary login details.</p>

  <h3>7. Terminal Access</h3>
  <p>Use the provided command in your terminal to access and manage your rented GPU node, enabling you to begin computational tasks immediately.</p>

  <h3>8. Graphix AI Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
  <p>If you have spare GPU capacity, you can contribute to the decentralized network by lending out your GPU resources through the <a href="https://app.graphix-ai.io">Graphix AI Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. By leveraging this tool, you can securely lend GPU power to support various computational tasks and earn revenue while contributing to decentralized computing.</p>
